"Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of Student Exam Performance"
""
"Instructions:"
""
"1.      Install Required Libraries: Ensure you have the following libraries installed:"
""
"pip install streamlit pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly"
""
"2.      Download the dataset (student-mat.csv)"
"Link - https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Bz9q37BB20PJSWsdGH__cshZGfPKSpHd?usp=sharing"
""
"3.      Create a new Python file (e.g., student_performance.py) and set up the basic structure of your Streamlit app"
""
"4.      Activity Tasks"
"a. Load the dataset into the Streamlit app."
"b. Display the first few rows of the dataset."
"c. Show dataset information (e.g., data types, missing values)."
"d. Generate summary statistics for the dataset."
"e. Create a heatmap to visualize correlations between features."
"f. Display a boxplot for exploratory visualization of numeric features."
"g. Use Plotly to create an interactive scatter plot of student performance."
""
"5.	Questions"
"a. Which features have the highest correlation with the final exam scores (G1, G2, G3)?"
"b. How does study time correlate with exam performance?"
"c. What insights can you draw from the boxplot?"
"d. How does gender impact the final exam score?"
""
"Grade Booster:"
""
"? Add more interactive widgets in Streamlit to filter the dataset (e.g., by gender or parental education)."
""
"? Use other visualization techniques such as (1) bar charts and (2) pair plots to analyze other features."
""
"? Make your Streamlit app look more like a dashboard, you can organize the layout using columns, tabs, and other widgets for filtering and interacting with the data."
""
"Submit the following:"
"1. Source code"
"2. Video Screen record of your output (Max of 2mins only)"
