```

## 🎯 Usage Instructions

1. **Start the Application**

   ```bash
   streamlit run student_performance.py
   ```

2. **Navigate the Dashboard**

   - Use the sidebar filters to explore different data subsets
   - Switch between tabs to see different analyses
   - Interact with plots by hovering, zooming, and selecting

3. **Answer Lab Questions**

   - Go to the "🎯 Interactive Analysis" tab
   - Review the automatic analysis of each lab question
   - Use the interactive visualizations to explore further

4. **Record Your Video**
   - Use screen recording software to capture your dashboard
   - Show the key features and analysis results
   - Keep the video under 2 minutes as required

## 📝 Submission Requirements

1. **Source Code**: Submit the `student_performance.py` file
2. **Video Recording**: 2-minute screen recording showing:
   - Dataset loading and basic information
   - Correlation analysis
   - Interactive visualizations
   - Lab questions analysis

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Dataset Not Found**

   - Ensure `student-mat.csv` is in the same directory as the Python file
   - Check the file name is exactly `student-mat.csv`

2. **Import Errors**

   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install all dependencies
   - Ensure you're using Python 3.7 or higher

3. **Port Already in Use**
